formaBull is an Electron application for React Developers who want to quickly generate forms. You can create the shape of your forms by dragging elements in, and style them in-app by adjusting sliders in the Style tab, making it a true one stop shop for everything form related and relieving software engineers of something they find very painful - repetitive coding!
